# Cloud Infrastructure with Flask App  

End-to-end AWS project deploying a 3-tier Flask application with Terraform.  
Built to demonstrate real-world cloud engineering practices including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), application deployment, monitoring, and security hardening.  

---

## üåê Current Status  

- ‚úÖ Infrastructure deployed via Terraform (VPC, subnet, IGW, security group, EC2)  
- ‚úÖ EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2, accessible via SSH and HTTP  
- ‚úÖ Flask app created and tested locally with `/` and `/health` endpoints  
- ‚úÖ Nginx reverse proxy serving app on port 80  
- üîÑ Next: Replace Flask dev server with Gunicorn + systemd
